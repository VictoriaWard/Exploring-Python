## Programs created with Python 3.3

Here you will find some programs I have created using Python 3.3:  
  
  
### MIT Open Courseware 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Problem Sets:

#### PS1: Paying Off Credit Card Debt

##### Problem 1 - Paying the Minimum: 

>A program that calculates the total amount paid in a year and the remaining balance 
after a year when paying the minimum payment, with a given outstanding balance annual 
interest rate and minimum monthly payment rate.
 
##### Problem 2 - Paying Debt Off In a Year:

>A program that calculates the minimum monthly payment needed (to the nearest Â£10) in 
order to pay off the total outstanding balance in 11 monthly payments, with a given 
outstanding balance and annual interest rate.

##### Problem 3 - Paying Debt Off In a Year (with bisection search)
  
>A version of problem 2 program that uses lower and upper bounds and a bisection search 
to quickly calculate monthly payment to nearest penny.

#### PS2: Successive Approximation

##### Problems 1, 2, 3 - Polynomials, Derivatives and Newton's Method:

>A program that uses Newton's method of successive approximation to find the root of a 
given polynomial function.

##### Problem 4 - Hangman:

>A one player version of the classic hangman game.

 
  
### battleship.py 

>A simple version of the classic battleship game.

>The idea of designing a battleship game came from a much smaller project I completed 
as part of the codeacademy Python course, a version of the game involving one single 
squared battleship and three allowed guesses. 

>After learning more about Python I have gradually developed the version here, which 
currently includes the following features:
* player chooses board size
* 4 ships
* ships of different sizes (1, 2 and 3 square)
* player allowed 10 guesses
* play again option



### abusive_height_converter.py

>Converts user's height in cm to feet, or vice versa, then comments on user's height.
