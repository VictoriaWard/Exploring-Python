## Programs created with Python 3.3

Here you will find some programs I have created using Python 3.3:  
  
  

### abusive_height_converter.py

>Converts user's height in cm to feet, or vice versa, then comments on user's height.  
  
  


### battleship.py 

>A simple version of the classic battleship game.

>The idea of designing a battleship game came from a much smaller project I completed 
as part of the codeacademy Python course, a version of the game involving one single 
squared battleship and three allowed guesses. 

>After learning more about Python I have gradually developed the version here, which 
currently includes the following features:
* player chooses board size
* 4 ships
* ships of different sizes (1, 2 and 3 square)
* player allowed 10 guesses
* play again option
