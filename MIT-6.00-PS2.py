"""
Problem #1
Implement the evaluate_poly function. This function evaluates a
polynomial function for the given x value. It takes in a tuple of
numbers poly and a number x. By number, we mean that x and each
element of poly is a float. evaluate_poly takes the polynomial
represented by poly and computes its value at x. It returns this value
as a float.
"""

def evaluate_poly(poly, x):
    """
    Computes the polynomial function for a given value x. Returns that value.

    Example:
    >>> poly = (0.0, 0.0, 5.0, 9.3, 7.0)    # f(x) = 7x^4 + 9.3x^3 + 5x^2
    >>> x = -13

Problem #2
Implement the compute_deriv function. This function computes the
derivative of a polynomial function. It takes in a tuple of numbers
poly and returns the derivative, which is also a polynomial
represented by a tuple.

    derivative is 0, returns (0.0,).

"""
Problem #3
Implement the compute_root function. This function applies Newtonâ€™s
method of successive approximation to find a root of the polynomial
function. It ends when it finds a root x such that the absolute value
of f(x) is less than epsilon, i.e. f(x) is close enough to zero. It
returns the root it found as a float.
